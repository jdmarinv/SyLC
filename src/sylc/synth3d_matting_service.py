        A fixed 120 ms grace made ``exp(-(age-120)/420)`` a hard ceiling on the
        score, so the 313-420 ms inference measured on the 4K/10-bit path could
        not reach CONTOUR_MIN_CONFIDENCE whatever the image evidence
        said — the full alpha reconstruction was closed by arithmetic on
        exactly the content that motivated it.  The unavoidable part of the age
        is the pipeline's own delivery latency, so only staleness ON TOP of
        that is charged.  Capping the grace at 65% of the hard horizon leaves
        useful image-evidence margin at the measured 420 ms upper latency: its
        age ceiling is 0.823, so an otherwise-good 0.85 evidence term can still
        cross the contour gate at full coverage.

        The second cap keeps the horizon, not the score, as the binding
        constraint at ANY configured horizon: AGE_GATE_MARGIN_MS is the
        staleness needed for the age term to fall to CONTOUR_MIN_CONFIDENCE, so
        a grace of H - that margin puts the term at the threshold on expiry,
        and anything smaller puts it below.  At the 520 ms default the
        proportional cap still binds (338 ms vs 358 ms) and behaviour is
        unchanged: the age term at expiry is 0.648.

        One documented limit: MIN_AGE_GRACE_MS is a floor, so the derived cap
        can only be honoured while H - AGE_GATE_MARGIN_MS >= MIN_AGE_GRACE_MS,
        i.e. above a ~282 ms horizon.  Below that the hard horizon is tighter
        than the decay itself and dominates the outcome regardless.  The
        promotion invariant does not rely on this cap arithmetically — see
        _contour_age_limit_ms, which enforces it by construction.

        solving for g looked equivalent, but the exponential does not
        round-trip: with g = H - AGE_GATE_MARGIN_MS the term evaluates to
        0.6800000000000002 at 45 of the integer horizons where that cap binds,
        one ulp above the threshold, which admits the very case the cap exists
        to exclude.  Repairing that by nudging the margin buys well under an
        ulp and is empirically clean at best.

        Stating the invariant as an age comparison removes the question rather
        than shrinking it.  min() against the horizon is exact in binary
