# trt_runtime.py
"""GPU detection and TensorRT-runtime status, for the depth-model dialog.

STDLIB ONLY, and NO Qt import -- the same rule as model_fetcher.py, for the same
two reasons: this module is compiled into the frozen player, so a third-party
dependency here would have to be bundled too; and keeping Qt out means the whole
detection/status path is testable without a QApplication. The Qt layer lives in
model_download_dialog.py.

The GPU architecture is DETECTED, never asked. It selects exactly one thing --
the per-architecture kernel blob inside the TensorRT wheel -- and a wrong answer
costs either a failed 70-minute engine compile or a runtime that builds nothing.

`runtime_status` REPRODUCES the gate in `SyLC_3D_Player._synth3d_ort_dir()`; it
is deliberately not a second, more permissive opinion about what counts as a
usable TensorRT install. An incomplete or unverified assembly does not fail
gracefully -- it takes the process down with a hard native abort during the
first real engine build, which is the whole reason the `.trt_verified` marker
exists. If the two ever disagree, this module must be the one that is wrong.
