# =============================================================================
# 2D->3D AI DEPTH PRESETS — (model candidates, inference grid) pairs
# =============================================================================
# Display order in the AI menu AND the inter-preset fallback order.
#
# Each entry pairs its candidate models with the square inference grid those
# graphs were exported for, and the two ALWAYS travel together from here to
# NativeRenderer.set_synth3d(..., side=): the grid is part of the shared depth
# service's cache key and of the ONNX graph's own fixed input shape, so a model
# opened against a service built for another grid is rejected by DepthEngine —
# after having already paid for a full ORT session build. Nothing downstream
# re-derives the grid from a filename, a resolution or a default, which is what
# makes that mismatch unreachable rather than merely unlikely.
#
# Candidates within one preset are therefore SAME-SIDE only. `da3_small.onnx` is
# the round-2 dynamic-axes export (no grid in its name because it accepts any),
# kept last in the Quality chain so an install directory holding only that file
# still works. A preset with no candidate on disk is greyed out in the menu, and
# if it is somehow the active one the resolution walks this order from the top —
# each preset with ITS OWN grid, so however far down it lands the pair is still
# one entry's.

# non-nominal depth per seek -- flat 2D, then depth computed on the SQUARE
# 756x756 grid over 2.376:1 content, then flat again, then the 300 ms ramp --
# and re-primes EMA/plate/tone/history TWICE instead of once.
# It only ever guarded against a matte that changes mid-title (a Scope/IMAX
# reel switch). A selection earned from the CODED frame dimensions cannot be
# invalidated by a seek: those dimensions belong to the file, not to the
